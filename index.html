                [ˈmaːrjo]) is a fictional character in the Mario video game franchise, owned by Nintendo and created by
                Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Acting as the company's mascot, as well as being the
                eponymous protagonist of the series, Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation.
                Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures
                generally center upon rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser. His fraternal twin brother
                and sidekick is Luigi.</p>
